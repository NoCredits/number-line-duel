# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Menu Navigation Buttons
**Problem:** 
- Menu button on main menu (☰) wasn't connected
- Back button in lobby acted as toggle instead of going back to menu
- No menu button in game screen

**Solution:**
- Connected `menuBtnMain` to toggle navigation
- Fixed `menuBtnLobby` to properly go back to main menu (removed duplicate listener)
- Added `menuBtnGoose` button to game screen with proper styling
- All menu buttons now work correctly

### 2. ✅ PowerUp Cards (Steal Card, Detector, etc.)
**Problem:**
- PowerUp cards existed but had no implementation
- Clicking "Use" button did nothing
- Cards: Steal Card, Trap Detector, Trap Removal, Undo, Mirror

**Solution:**
- **Server Side:** Added `usePowerUp()` method in `GooseGame.ts` with full implementation:
  - **Steal Card:** Takes random card from opponent
  - **Trap Detector:** Reveals all traps for 3 turns
  - **Trap Removal:** Removes a hidden trap from board
  - **Undo:** Moves player back 3 spaces
  - **Mirror:** Reflects next trap back to opponent

- **Server Socket:** Added `gooseUsePowerUp` event handler in `Server.ts`
- **Client Side:** 
  - Added `onPowerUpUse` callback in `goose-ui.ts`
  - Fixed usePowerUpBtn to call correct handler
  - Wired up callback in `goose-game.ts`

### 3. ✅ Discard & Draw Feature
**Problem:**
- Skip turn button was recently added but needed testing

**Status:**
- Already implemented in previous session
- Should work: appears when player has no movement cards
- Discards all cards and draws 3 new ones

### 4. ✅ Leave Game Functionality
**Problem:**
- No way to leave/quit current game
- Players stuck in game without exit option

**Solution:**
- Added "Leave Game" button to navigation menu
- Button shows only when in active game (gameScreen or gooseGameScreen)
- Hidden in lobby/menu screens
- Confirmation dialog before leaving
- Returns player to main menu

## Known Limitations

1. **Trap Removal:** Currently removes first hidden trap, not player-selected
2. **Undo:** Moves back 3 spaces instead of exact previous position (would need move history)
3. **Detector:** Currently makes all traps visible permanently (should be temporary per player)

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. Add trap selection UI for Trap Removal powerup
2. Implement move history for proper Undo functionality
3. Make Detector effect player-specific (opponent shouldn't see revealed traps)
4. Add visual indicators for active effects (detector, shield, mirror)
5. Add sound effects for powerup usage
6. Add animations for card stealing and trap removal
