```

npm start
```

Check these:

1. **TypeScript Compiled?** Make sure you ran `npm run build` in both client and server
2. **Server Running?** Check that the server is active on the correct port
3. **Browser Cache?** Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
4. **Console Errors?** Open browser dev tools (F12) and check for errors
