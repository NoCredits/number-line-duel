## 🎮 How to Use Artillery Duel

### Starting a Game

**Client-Side Code:**
```typescript
import { ArtilleryGameClient, ArtilleryUIManager } from './games/artillery-duel';

// Initialize UI
const artilleryUI = new ArtilleryUIManager();

// Initialize game client
const artilleryGame = new ArtilleryGameClient(socket, artilleryUI, '');
artilleryGame.setPlayerId(socket.id);

// Join queue (easy, medium, or hard)
artilleryGame.joinQueue('medium');
```
