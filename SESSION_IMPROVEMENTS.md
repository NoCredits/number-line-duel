# 🎮 Session Improvements Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. 🔐 Player Name Persistence & Auto-Login
**Implementation:**
- Player name saved to `localStorage` when logging in
- Auto-populated in login input on page reload
- Auto-login: If player name exists in localStorage, skip login screen and go directly to main menu
- Name persists across browser sessions

**Code Changes:**
- `client/src/client.ts` - `loadPlayerData()`: Added playerName loading and auto-populate
- `client/src/client.ts` - `handleLogin()`: Added localStorage.setItem for playerName
- `client/src/client.ts` - `constructor()`: Added auto-login check

**User Experience:**
```
First Visit: Login Screen → Enter Name → Main Menu
Next Visit: Directly to Main Menu (name remembered)
```

### 2. 📊 Stats Tracking & Persistence
**What's Tracked:**
- Games played count
- Games won count  
- Game history (last X games with results, opponent, date)
- Win rate percentage

**Storage:**
- All stats saved to `localStorage`
- Persists across sessions
- Survives browser refresh

**Display Locations:**
- Side navigation menu (☰)
- Player stats section
- Recent games history

### 3. 🎮 Game List Fixed for Goose Mode
**Problem:** Game list was always requesting Number Line games, not Goose games

**Solution:**
- `requestGamesList()` now checks `selectedGameMode`
- Emits `requestGooseGamesList` when in Goose mode
- Emits `requestGamesList` when in Number Line mode
- Auto-refreshes every 3 seconds while in lobby

**Result:** Available Goose games now show up in the lobby!

### 4. 🔄 Multiplayer Connection Fixed
**The Race Condition:**
- Server emitted events instantly: `gooseGameJoined` → `gooseGameState` → `gooseGameStarted`
- Client took ~100ms to load module and setup listeners
- `gooseGameStarted` event was lost before listeners were ready

**Solution:**
- Client now checks `gameState.gameStatus` immediately upon receiving `gooseGameJoined`
- If status is `'playing'`, shows game board immediately
- No longer relies on the `gooseGameStarted` event
- Both players now see the game board simultaneously ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/client.ts` - Enhanced `gooseGameJoined` handler
- `client/src/goose-game.ts` - Added debug logging
- `server/src/Server.ts` - Added `gooseGameJoined` emission

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Turn System Not Switching
**Observation:** Player 1 (aaaa) takes their turn, but Player 2 (bbbb) remains stuck on "Opponent's Turn"

**Cause:** The game engine returns success after a move but doesn't automatically switch turns

**Possible Solutions:**
1. Auto-end turn after playing a movement card
2. Add an explicit "End Turn" button for players
3. Make turn ending automatic after all actions complete

**Location to Fix:** `server/src/GooseGame.ts` - `playMovementCard()` method should call `this.endTurn()` after successful move
