- **Matchmaking Queue**: Players automatically matched when two join queue
- **Turn-Based Combat**: Players take turns firing at each other
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic projectile motion with gravity and wind
- **Terrain**: Randomly generated hills for strategic gameplay
- **Health System**: Each player starts with 100 health, loses 20 per hit
- **Dynamic Wind**: Changes slightly each turn, affects projectile trajectory
- **Victory Condition**: First player to reduce opponent's health to 0 wins

### Technical Features
- **Canvas Rendering**: 1000x600 pixel game board with smooth animations
- **Real-Time Multiplayer**: Socket.io for instant communication
- **Server-Authoritative**: All physics calculated on server for fairness
- **Trajectory Animation**: RequestAnimationFrame for smooth projectile motion
- **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Login**: Enter your player name on the main screen
2. **Select Artillery Duel**: Click the üí£ Artillery Duel game card
3. **Wait for Match**: Game automatically finds an opponent (shows "Searching for opponent...")
4. **Take Your Turn**: 
   - Adjust angle (0-90 degrees)
   - Set power (1-100)
   - Click "Fire!" button
   - Watch the projectile arc through the air
5. **Win the Game**: Reduce opponent's health to 0

## üîß Socket Events

### Client ‚Üí Server
- `joinArtilleryQueue`: Player joins matchmaking queue
- `artilleryFire`: Player fires projectile with angle and power

### Server ‚Üí Client
- `artilleryMatchFound`: Match found, sends room ID and initial game state
- `artilleryShotFired`: Projectile fired, sends trajectory points for animation
- `artilleryHit`: Player was hit, sends victim ID and remaining health
- `artilleryTurnChanged`: Turn switched, sends next player's ID
- `artilleryWindChanged`: Wind updated, sends new wind value
- `artilleryGameOver`: Game finished, sends winner ID and name

## üöÄ Testing Instructions

1. **Start Servers**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Server
   cd server
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Client
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open Two Browser Windows**:
   - Window 1: http://localhost:3000
   - Window 2: http://localhost:3000

3. **Play a Match**:
   - Both windows: Login with player names
   - Both windows: Click Artillery Duel game card
   - Wait for "Match found!" message
