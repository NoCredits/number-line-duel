# Number Line Duel - Game Features & Architecture

## âœ… Current Implementation

### Core Game Mechanics
- **Shared Token Movement**: Both players control a single token on a number line (0-50)
- **Target Number**: Random target between 15-35 that players race to reach exactly
- **Draft vs Play**: Players can either draft cards from central row or play cards from hand
- **Illegal Move Prevention**: Moves that would go below 0 or above 50 are blocked
- **Hate-drafting**: Take cards your opponent needs to block their strategy

### Card System
- **Add Cards**: +1, +2, +3, +4, +5 (most common, 2 of each)
- **Subtract Cards**: -1, -2, -3 (less common)
- **Multiply Cards**: Ã—2, Ã—3 (rare but powerful)
- **Balanced Deck**: 13 total cards with strategic distribution

### User Interface
- **Visual Number Line**: Animated token and target position
- **Card Highlighting**: Shows illegal moves with red border
- **Turn Indicators**: Clear whose turn it is
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant game state synchronization
- **Card Types**: Color-coded by operation type

### Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io + TypeScript
- **Frontend**: Vite + TypeScript + CSS animations
- **Real-time**: WebSocket communication for instant updates
- **Shared Types**: Type-safe communication between client/server

## ðŸš€ Potential Expansions (Future Development)

### 1. Enhanced Cards
```typescript
// Special ability cards
const SPECIAL_CARDS = [
  { type: 'swap', effect: 'Swap token position with target' },
  { type: 'double', effect: 'Next card played twice' },
  { type: 'steal', effect: 'Take random card from opponent' },
  { type: 'peek', effect: 'See opponent\'s hand' },
  { type: 'block', effect: 'Opponent skips next turn' }
];
```

### 2. Multiple Game Modes
- **Dual Tokens**: Each player has their own token
- **Moving Target**: Target number changes every few turns
- **Hazard Zones**: Certain numbers are off-limits
- **Team Mode**: 2v2 with shared hands

### 3. Tournament System
- **Lobby System**: Multiple concurrent games
- **Spectator Mode**: Watch games in progress
- **Ranking System**: ELO-based player ratings
- **Best of 3**: Multi-round matches

### 4. AI Opponents
```typescript
interface AIStrategy {
  evaluateMove(gameState: GameState): number;
  shouldDraft(card: Card, gameState: GameState): boolean;
  predictOpponentMove(gameState: GameState): Card[];
}
```

### 5. Advanced UI Features
- **Card Animations**: Smooth card playing animations
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for moves
- **Themes**: Different visual styles
- **Mobile Support**: Touch-friendly interface
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support

### 6. Analytics & Statistics
- **Game History**: Track all moves and outcomes
- **Win Rate**: Player statistics
- **Strategy Analysis**: Most effective card combinations
- **Replay System**: Watch previous games

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Depth Analysis

### Current Strategy Elements
1. **Resource Management**: Limited hand size forces tough decisions
2. **Timing**: When to draft vs when to play
3. **Opponent Prediction**: Reading their needs to hate-draft
4. **Risk Assessment**: Weighing immediate vs future moves
5. **Mathematical Planning**: Calculating exact paths to target

### Example Strategic Scenario
```
Current Position: 12
Target: 25
Central Row: [+3, +5, Ã—2, -1, +4]
Your Hand: [+2, Ã—3]
Opponent Hand: 3 cards

Strategic Options:
1. Play Ã—3 â†’ Position 36 (too high, need -11 somehow)
2. Draft +5, then play +2 next turn â†’ Position 14, need 11 more
3. Play +2 â†’ Position 14, hope opponent doesn't take +3 or Ã—2
4. Draft Ã—2 to deny opponent powerful combo
```

This creates a rich decision space where players must balance:
- **Immediate tactical needs** vs **long-term positioning**
- **Personal advancement** vs **opponent disruption**
- **Safe moves** vs **risky but rewarding plays**
